# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 1ST & 2ND WEEKS PROJECTS
Welcome to my 1st & 2nd week projects for the 'Become a Software Developer' RR's course.
You'll find here the HTML structure and CSS styles for two different articles.

## Description
The objective of the 1st week project was to copy the HTML structure of an article, I chose this one:
[Euro News - This solar powered mobile home doesn't need to recharge or refuel](https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/09/17/this-solar-powered-mobile-home-doesn-t-need-to-recharge-or-refuel#)

The file for this project is the one named 'index.html'  
In it, you'll find:
* All of the new's article text content
* Links
* Images
* A video

For the 2nd week, the project consisted on copying another article (from a different site) and, this time, not only the HTML strucrure was required but the CSS styles too.  
Also, the first week's html file needed to be linked to these styles.  
For this week, I chose the article:
[DeepMind tells Google it has no idea how to make AI less toxic](https://thenextweb.com/news/deepmind-tells-google-no-idea-make-ai-less-toxic)

The files for this project are named 'deepmind-tells-google-no-idea-make-ai-less-toxic.html' (for the HTML structure) and 'index.css' inside the 'Styles' folder (for the styling).  
You will also find a 'reset.css' file used to formatting the default styles.

Both the first week HTML file and the second one are linked to the same stylesheet (index.css).  
In each of them you will also find a button that leads you to the other.

## Clarifications
* Fonts had to be changed. The fonts that the original website use must be purchased. I tried my best searching for the most similar fonts on Google Fonts.
* Most of the colors used are the same as the original website... In some cases I had to find them by eye as I couldn't find the original color by inspecting the page.
* Webpage definitely isn't pixel perfect :sweat_smile:.
* Some elements where omitted. This is the case of the dropdown menus of the navigation bar, for example. I didn't have nor the resources nor the time to do research for implementing them. Maybe next time :yum:
