# RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 1ST WEEK PROJECT 
Welcome to my 1st week project for the 'Become a Software Developer' RR's course.
You'll find here an HTML structure for a new's article.

## Description

For this project I copied the HTML structure of this article:

You'll find:
* All of the new's article text content
